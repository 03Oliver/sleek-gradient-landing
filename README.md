# sleek-gradient-landing

Sleek white on black gradient "Coming soon" landing page with the copy:

collective.vc
loading ... 
... reinventing ourselves.



and then have a semi-large white linkedin logo that is hyperlinked
https://www.linkedin.com/company/collectivevc

ensure every text and content is neatly spaced.

ensure there are no white borders and the background is maximised, covering all.

If possible, use roboto font, and make the text dynamic text, as if it was being typed out.
